# PLP_Getready_Agency_website_finalProjectLMS

/////// This file includes the Web and Databases courses in the LMS at PLP program as a final project //////////  


üöß Current Development Status
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project is still under development and not fully complete. I am actively working on:

- Database improvements: Resolving certain issues to ensure smooth functionality.
- Admin User Page: Developing a feature that allows the website administrator to create and manage blog posts directly from the admin panel without modifying the website's core.
- Frontend and Backend Enhancements: Improving the user experience and optimizing performance.

..... This website is my personal project, and I am committed to refining it further. While the current version has been built from scratch, I also maintain a WordPress-based version of the site and plan to fully transition it to a custom-coded solution for enhanced flexibility and performance...... 

As this is my personal project, I aim to publish it soon by deploying it to my Hostinger domain (getready-global.com) *you can take a look*. However, I submitted the project in its current state to meet the graduation deadline.
